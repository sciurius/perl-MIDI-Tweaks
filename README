MIDI-Tweaks
===========

This module implements a number of MIDI tweaks using the Sean Burke's
MIDI module.

Tweaks include: selecting tracks, changing volume and velocity,
splitting multiple notes into separate tracks.

More tweaks to follow.

Two scripts are provided:

  midi-tweak: applies some tweaks to MIDI files
  midi-dump: dumps contents of a MIDI file in an understandable format

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. The code works fine, but the interface may
change when new feaures are added.
